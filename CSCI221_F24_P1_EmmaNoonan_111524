# Calculator

## Description
This program creates a calculator, allowing users to enter commands directly through the console or with the use of a `.txt` file. Users can enter input continuously until the word `EXIT` (case-insensitive) is provided.

## Usage
1. The program begins with a welcome message, prompting the user to input commands.
2. If the user inputs a command directly through the console:
	- The command is processed, and the program prints the output in the format: `Result: [calculated result]`.
	- Here is a sample:
		System.out.println("Here are the operations that you can do: add, subtract, multiply, divide, find the power of (pow), and find the root of (root), square root (sqrt)");
		System.out.println("Example input: add 5 2");
		System.out.println("Program will return 7.0");
		System.out.println("Another example input: pow 3 2");
		System.out.println("Program will return 9.0");
		System.out.println("Another example input: root 256 4");
		System.out.println("Program will return 4.0");
3. If the user provides an improper command:
	- An error message will appear, and the program will prompt the user to input another command (hopefully the user will learn from prior mistakes).
4. If the user inputs a `.txt` file:
	- The program reads the entire file, processes each line, and prints results line by line.
	- For invalid lines, the program outputs `Invalid Command` but continues to process subsequent lines in the file.
5. The program will continue to accept input until the word `EXIT` is input.
