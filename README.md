# Calculator
A Java-based calculator program that performs basic and advanced mathematical operations. Accepts user input through the console or a .txt file and handles continuous input until 'EXIT' is provided. This project was created for my CSCI 221: Computer Programming II class in the Fall 2024 semester.
